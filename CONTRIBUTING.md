- Implementing more sophisticated network analysis
- Creating topic modeling systems for emerging field identification

### 5. Documentation & Testing

- Writing clear documentation for both users and developers
- Creating comprehensive test suites
- Developing benchmark datasets for validation

## Getting Started as a Contributor

### Environment Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scivalidate.git
   cd scivalidate
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```
5. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes, writing tests as appropriate
3. Run the test suite to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages
5. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. Create a pull request against the main repository

## Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- Maintain test coverage for new features
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation to reflect any changes you've made
2. Include tests that verify your changes work as expected
3. Ensure your code passes all existing tests
4. Update the README.md if necessary
5. Your pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer
